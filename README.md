# Psion_TxtConv
This is a tool for Psion PDA I developed in 2003-ish.
I have uploaded it after multiple people expressed interest in it, probably for the purpose of software archaeology.

There is a readme file in Russian here:
binary/readme_rus.txt

Which I can not even adequately translate, becasue I haven't been owning Psion for decades.
